# transport-api
In Sweden, we don't have an API that can help you to get some information about your vehicle. Here I started to build a project which can be helpful for your application to ex. react-native and etc.

# how to use locally: 

1. Clone git repo: https://github.com/azizzakiryarov/transport-api.git
2. You can start the appliation with IDE or with command line
3. curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transports/get/{registration-number}
